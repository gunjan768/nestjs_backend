Types of Logs

. Log - General purpose logging of important information
. Warning - Unhandled issue that is NOT fatal or derstructive
. Error - Unhandled issue than is fatal or derstructive
. Debug - Useful information that can help us debug the logic in case of an error/warning. Intended for developers
. Verbose - information providing insights about the behaviour of the application. Intended for operators (for example, support). Usually 
"too much information".

Configuration:

. Central way of defining values that are loaded upon starting the application (should not be changed during the runtime)
. Configuration per environment - development, staging, production etc.
. Configuration can be defined in the code base. Useful if you work with multiple developers via version control. Your configuration should
always work for with the code it ships with.
. Can be defined in many ways (JSON, YAML, XML, Environment Variables, etc) using custom solutions or open source libraries.

Codebase Vs Environment Variables

. You could define configuration in your codebase. For example, in a config folder.
. You could also support configuring values via environment variables (which are provided when running the application).
